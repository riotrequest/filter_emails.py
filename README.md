# Spamtrap Hit Detector

## Overview
This Python script is designed to assist email system administrators and cybersecurity professionals in identifying potential spamtrap interactions within their email logs. By leveraging the `hvmail_get_possible_spamtrap_hits` command, the script scans for emails sent from a specified IP address over a designated date and time range, extracting email addresses that may be spamtraps.

## Features
- Automates the detection of possible spamtrap hits from specified IP addresses.
- Configurable date and time range for targeted analysis.
- Outputs identified email addresses to a CSV file for easy review and further analysis.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Access to the `hvmail_get_possible_spamtrap_hits` command
- Appropriate permissions to execute the script and analyze email logs

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Edit the script variables (`date`, `ip_address`, `start_hour`, `end_hour`) to match your specific analysis requirements.
3. Run the script in your environment: `python3 spamtrap_detector.py`
4. Review the output CSV file (`email_addresses.csv`) for potential spamtrap hits.

## Important Note
Ensure you have the necessary permissions to analyze and process email data. Always comply with privacy laws and regulations.
